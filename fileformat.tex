\sec Format of Recorded Data

Data is stored by using rosbag (tool of ROS) in the format ".bag" to the folder saved in the "local_options.py" file ("path_to_workspace/clopema_cvut/"\nl"clopema_collect_model_data/src/local_options.py").


\sec Topics

Of reason saving disk space and capacity of the transmission channel are recorded only selected topics which are saved in "topics.txt" ("path_to_workspace/clopema_cvut/"\nl"clopema_collect_model_data/matlab/topics/topics.txt"). For this experiment I~choose these topics:

\sec Format of Names of Recorded Files

Recorded files have names in the form "name_speed_AX.bag" (table~\ref[explanation])

\chap Results

We assume that if we capture one piece of the garment multiple times in the same way the results of such measurements will be similar. Therefore, we performed five identical measurements of one garment. The garment is held in the gripper the same way in all cases of measurements.

The dependences of displacement $\Delta z_k$ on the time are shown in the figure~\ref[fig:graph6pos] and dependences of speed of the points on the time are shown in the figure~\ref[fig:graph6speed]. For these identical measurements was chosen garment - green towel (shown in the figure~\ref[tab:description].d) and way of holding the garment - (fig.~\ref[fig:specialcases].e).

We can see on the figures~\ref[fig:graph6pos] and~\ref[fig:graph6speed] that the dependences of all measured sequences are similar.
